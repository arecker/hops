  <h2>We're a free, community curated museum!</h2>
  <p>
    We want you to get involved in our project!  You can help us out by becoming
    a Hoppourtunist or by volunteering - and we are more than happy to accept donations!

    Got an idea for something you've always thought was cool,
    but have never seen anyone do?  Let us know!  Our exhibits
    are developed <em>with</em> our community and <em>for</em>
    our community, so let us know what you'd like to see.
